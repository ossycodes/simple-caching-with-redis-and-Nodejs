THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF CACHING IN REDIS.

SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HERE ? 

WE HAVE A FAKE LIST OF MATCHED USERS FOR A GIVEN USER (THE LOGGED IN THE USER).

1)WE FIRST MAKE A TRIP TO THE DATABASE (FAKE) TO  GET A LIST OF THE MACTHEDUSERS FOR THE GIVEN USER (THE LOGGEDIN USER) 

2)WE THEN PURGE THE CACHE WITH THE KEY (USERID),
AND THEN,
WE STORE THIS MATCHEDUSERS IN THE CACHE WITH THE USER ID AS KEY AND THE PAGE SIZE OR LIMIT AS FIELD

<br><br>
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

`USER#USERID MACTCHEDPAGE#PAGESIZEORLIMIT
EG user5ea708a40c244528c0e076c8 matchedpage1` 
<br><br>
3) THEN ON SUBSEQUENT REQUEST WE JUST FETCH THE MATCHEDUSERS FROM CACHE INSTEAD OF GIONG TO THE DATABASE,
UNTIL IT EXPIRES (AFTER ONE DAY, WHICH WAS WHAT I SET TO BE TTL)
